!Series_summary	"During superficial temporal artery (STA)-middle cerebral artery (MCA) anastomoses, micro-samples of both MCA and STA from the patients with MMD (n=4) and internal carotid artery aneurysm (IA) (n=4) were collected. Using microarray technique, transcriptome-wide analyses were performed. Comparing MCA gene expression profile between MMD and IA, we detected 39 up-regulated and 12 down-regulated genes in MMD, showing over 15-fold change with significant difference (P<0.05). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed positive correlation of inflammatory response and negative correlation of collagen formation with MCA of MMD. In addition, by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, significant increased gene expression of TLR2 (P=0.009) and SYK (P=0.04), and decreased gene expression of COL15A1 (P=0.0001) in MCA of MMD were confirmed. While in STA transcriptome analysis, no gene showed significant difference."
